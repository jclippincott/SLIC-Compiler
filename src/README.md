Jesse Lippincott
Compiler for CS 4223

Currently, the compiler can process everything in the SLIC language except for the modulus operator
I've included a script that I used to run all the necessary commands -- if you create a
	file named "in.slic" in the same directory as the compiler, containing the program to compile,
	then run c.sh, it will output the gstal program to "output.gstal"
